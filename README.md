# GitLiveLog

Tired of your GitHub activity graph making you look like you've been on a year-long sabbatical? Let GitLiveLog save you from commit embarrassment! 

This VS Code extension logs every actual keystroke of effort, not just squash merges or main-branch shenanigans. Every 30 minutes, it commits a bite-sized summary of your work to a private repo, so even your most thought-out PR plans don't vanish into the void of "one contribution."

With GitLiveLog, your heatmap can finally match your hard workâ€”whether you're a code monkey cranking out features or a software sage meticulously crafting brilliance. Bonus: perfect receipts for reviews, promotions, or just flexing to your indie hacker buddies.
